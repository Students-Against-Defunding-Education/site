	<h1>Students Against Defunding Education</h1><br>

	<h3>Who we are</h3>

	<p>We are a collective of University of Alberta student associations and individual students who are organizing to dissent against cuts and restructuring at the university, and to advocate for students and our admin colleagues who will suffer from extreme cuts to education under the current UCP government.</p>

	<h3>What we do</h3>

	<p>We are an independent organization of students who are committed to engaging students on restructuring, opposing the UCP’s cuts to advanced education and the University’s responses to these cuts, and participating in restructuring conversations through student and University hosted events, strategic stakeholder meetings, and social media.</p>
<!--ADD LINK TO FORM PAGE-->
	<p>We are currently hosting <a href="ADD LINK">a mass email campaign that anyone opposed to cuts to advanced education can participate in</a>. Follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UAGradStudentCollective/">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/UAGradStudents">Twitter</a> to keep up to date with current, ongoing, and upcoming actions and events.</p>

	<h2>FAQ</h2>

	<h3>What is restructuring?</h3>

	<p>Very simply, the University of Alberta’s restructuring plan is in response to the United Conservative Party’s disastrous <a href="https://aasua.ca/home/pres_message/government_consultations_job_loss_and_restructuring_consultation">$216-million dollar cut</a> to the institution. Restructuring involves merging faculties and laying off administrators. Administrative positions alone will account for between 1050-1100 job losses. The Student’s Union made a simple, informative video explaining the restructuring process <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CFlCVmgDqVT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&fbclid=IwAR2zgten3632zXgmOHPw8WLdYvbMUE1EKJhch92eypVXhlwvaD7XhCXwCNU">which can be viewed here</a>.</p>

	<h3>Why are we opposed?</h3>

	<p>The UCP’s cuts will result in increased class sizes and a rise in tuition as much as 7% a year over the next three years. These cuts alone will make education less accessible and place more financial burden on students and families. Further, with academic restructuring, more labour will be off-loaded onto those who are precariously employed, like graduate students, administrative staff, academic faculty, part-time instructors as full-time faculty course load increases. In light of such shifts, the quality of student experience will dramatically decline, as has been the case at other universities that have gone through similar restructuring processes, like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH2kI6VY7SI&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR3Q7vYJnMHu49-FvfFjAq59IzxGea66nJcn8suD278BklCYp2C_yEUidg8&ab_channel=UnionNASA">University of Sydney</a>.</p>

	<p>We are further opposed to the way in which the University has responded to the cuts by the UCP, and. We are against the way that university administration has shut students, staff, and faculty out of meaningful involvement in decision-making. Town halls have not been venues of meaningful discussion but instead places where talking points are delivered, and Q&A is privileged over critical conversation (<a href="https://thegatewayonline.ca/2020/10/editorial-u-of-a-tomorrow-undermines-advanced-education/">Pawluk, 2020</a>). The Non-Academic Staff Association (NASA) and the Association of Academic Staff University of Alberta (AASUA) have both already filed complaints after being shut out of key <a href="https://thegatewayonline.ca/2020/10/nasa-and-aasua-file-alrb-complaint-against-u-of-a/">decision-making bodies</a>. We believe that the quality of a university depends on a balance of academic collaboration and administrative management (<a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-u-of-a-needs-to-genuinely-engage-its-communities-before-making-massive-changes">Kahane & Schulz, 2020</a>) It is not too late to improve the restructuring process.</p>

	<h3>Where can I learn more?</h3>

	<p>Restructuring can be understood from a number of perspectives. Below is a collection of perspectives from across the University. This is not an exhaustive list.</p>

	<p class="bold">For the University’s perspective, see:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The University of Alberta’s <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/uofa-tomorrow/academic-restructuring/index.html">Academic Restructuring webpage</a>. This page provides an outline of the various models for restructuring as well as a number of resource links; including things such as the international models of restructuring upon which the University is drawing, a feedback and contact page, and links to  the most recent town hall events.</li>
		<li>The <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/uofa-tomorrow/media-library/interim-report-of-arwg-sept-2020.pdf">Interim Report of the Academic Restructuring Working Group</a>. This provides an overview of what restructuring may look like. It includes descriptions of how many university potions will be cut (1,050), proposals for the centralization of administrative positions, a requirement for a hiring freeze, the consolidation of various faculties, a proposed increase in the number of students attending the university as well as a proposed increase in tuition costs, etcetera. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GJIVSx2zr0">short video</a> also outlines the various proposed models. <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/uofa-tomorrow/media-library/arwg/revised-proposals-academic-restructuring-working-group.pdf">The report was updated in November</a> with new models for restructuring.</li>
		<li>Town Halls hosted by President Bill Flanagan and Provost Steven Dew on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgLzK0dYMPA">September 30</a> (addressing the potential models for restructuring), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=721bBB7vmrE">October 6</a> (addressing Service Excellence Transformation and administration restructuring), and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhGNm-fZZCw&feature=youtu.be">November 19</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="bold">For other perspectives on restructuring, see:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A panel organized by Dr. David Kahane of Political Science, which offered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lvrEM9T6vM">a space for professors to discuss their concerns and potential responses to restructuring</a>.</li>
		<li>The Gateway, the University of Alberta’s Student Newspaper, has written a number of critical articles regarding restructuring. For example, see: <a href="https://thegatewayonline.ca/2020/11/u-of-a-tomorrows-empty-consultation-process-leaves-out-vital-voices/">“U of A Tomorrow’s empty consultation process leaves out vital voices”</a> & <a href="https://thegatewayonline.ca/2020/11/student-calls-out-universitys-consultation-process-met-with-laughter-from-president/">“Student calls out university’s consultation process, met with laughter from president”</a></li>
		<li>The AASUA (Association of Academic Staff University of Alberta) <a href="https://aasua.ca/home/pres_message/aasua_declaration_on_u_of_a_for_tomorrow_uat">released a declaration on the restructuring process</a> on November 20, 2020.</li>
